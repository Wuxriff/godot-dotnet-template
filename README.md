# godot-dotnet-template
A general template for Godot 4 Mono. Includes:
- Project Settings and General Configuration for Export and Development
- CI/CD builds for Linux and Windows.
- Miscellaneous Utilities.

TODO: Adding delegates to signals seems to be broken for release builds on Linux specifically, make sure to update once that gets fixed.
